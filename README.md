3 different implementations of MNIST using pytorch, tensorflow, and no external ML Libraries (only numpy).

For the pytorch implementation, when you run the program, the MNIST dataset will download automatically. However for tensorflow, the dataset will not be downloaded to your local machine. Also, when you run the NN in the "scratch" folder, you need to download both the train.csv and test.csv files from the [kaggle MNIST database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv)
